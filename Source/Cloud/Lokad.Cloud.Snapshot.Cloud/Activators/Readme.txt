== Activators ==

Activators automatically activate/trigger domain commands (or report actions,
like pruning them) based on time only. They automate activation of tasks that
would else be activated manually and are thus considered to be external.
They can therefore access stale reports for decision & pre-validation of commands
to be queued without breaking CQRS principles.
